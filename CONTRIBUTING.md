# Example of adding a new Endpoint

Our project is all about great data to play with!
And I know of no one better than YOU (yes YOU) that knows what data YOU'D like to play with. 

In this section we'll learn how to add a new dataset (or "endpoint" as we'll call them)

Each endpoint needs three files. Here's a [example of a new PR adding just a new endpoint](https://github.com/jermbo/SampleAPIs/pull/89)

Here are the official steps to add an endpoint
1) Create a <i>endpointName</i>.json file (eg. baseball.json for SampleApis.com/api/baseball) with a value for each "collection" (so for "homeRuns" we end up with https://sampleapis.com/baseball/api/homeRuns because there's a array for the parameter "homeRuns" see [api/baseball.json](/src/api/baseball.json) for more details)
2) Create a ".backup" file which is a copy of the original  <i>endpointName</i>.json file (in our example it would be [baseball.json.backup](/src/api/baseball.json.backup) )
3) Add new entry to the module.exports array in the ```src/apiList.js``` file. Here you'll add information about the new endpoint you've added.

What the format of the new entry in the ```src/apiList.js``` will look like:
```javascript
// example from the rickandporty endpoint
    {
      id: 22,   ‚¨Ö //use a new ID
      title: "Rick And Morty",  ‚¨Ö //Title on top of page
      longDesc: "This is t...", ‚¨Ö //Description on the endpoint's page
      desc: "AP", ‚¨Ö // description for front page
      link: "rickandmorty", ‚¨Ö // endpoint url
      graphLink: "rickandmorty/graphql", // graphql endpoint
      endPoints: ["characters","episodes","locations"],  ‚¨Ö // All collections (or properties) in the endpoint from the endpointName.json file
      },
```
